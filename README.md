# Piazza Redesign

The piece of Piazza that can be redesigned is the message thread on a post. Currently, the piazza message thread allows users to respond to a post in the follow-up discussions. Users can post a followup discussion and other users can reply to on the follow-up discussion thread. This way students interact with one
another and can have conversations. One way to improve this design would be to add a Follow and Like button. The followup posts that have the most likes appear first. Users will also have the option to follow specific threads instead of following the entire post.



### Cognitive Load

The redesign reduces the cognitive load from the user. In the current interface, the user has to scroll down and read all the posts to find posts that are interesting or relevant to the topic. The redesign allows users to _Like_ and _Follow_. When users like a certain post they appear first on the page. This allows other users to easily find useful posts. In addition, the message threads followed by the user also appear in the start and the user also receives notification for message threads they are following.

### Direct Manipulation
The principle of direct manipulation is applied in the redesign. When the user clicks on the _Like_ or _Follow_ button the changes and the effect is immediately observed by the user. If a user finds a post interesting, they can click on the Like icon. Once the user clicks on the icon, the counter next to increases indicating that the _Like_ was acknowledged by the system. Similarly, if the clicks on the Follow button, the button text changes to Unfollow which indicates that the user is now following the post or discussion.

### Discoverability

Discoverability is the principle that the elements that the user intends to use on the interface are easily discoverable by the user. In the re-design, relevant message threads are easily discoverable by the user. The posts that have the most amount of Likes indicate that the discussion or post is popular and relevant to the current discussion. This allows students to directly read those posts instead of scrolling the page to look for relevant discussions. In addition, the Like icon and Follow button are clearly discoverable on each post and message thread.

### Tolerance

If a user _Follows_ or _Likes_ a post by mistake, they can easily reverse their action. For example, if a user clicks on the Like icon or the Follow button unintentionally they have the option to reverse their actions. This way, the design incorporates the principle of tolerance towards errors.

### Mental Model

A mental model is a personâ€™s understanding of how things work in the real world. In this redesign, an icon to _Like_ a post and a button to _Follow_ and _Unfollow_ a post matches the user's mental models.The user can interpret the effect clicking on the button or icon will produce just by glancing at the icon or button
